# Known defects

Things a ghostty pane gets **wrong**, as opposed to things it deliberately does
differently. Those live in [documented-diffs.md](documented-diffs.md), and the
distinction is the point: a diff is a decision with a cost attached, a defect is
a bug nobody chose.

**Each entry has a stable ID** (`KD-nn`), for the same reason the diffs do —
there is no issue tracker wired to this repository, so the ID is what an issue
would be filed against.

Each entry says how it was found, what is actually known versus suspected, and
**the measurement that would tell the hypotheses apart**. That last part matters
more than the hypothesis: this project has repeatedly produced a plausible cause
by reading source and had it turn out wrong.

### KD-01 — Kitty graphics images render distorted — **closed 2026-08-07, not a defect**

**Reported** by the user, from use: an image sent with the Kitty graphics
protocol appeared skewed — wrong aspect ratio, not merely the wrong size.

**Measured, and the engine is right on every count.** Kept as a closed entry
rather than deleted, because the wrong conclusion was reachable from every
direction and the measurements are what stopped it.

#### What was measured

Three probes into a live ghostty pane, each photographed with
`harness/wgc-shot` and measured in pixels rather than judged by eye:

1. **Natural size.** A 200x100 raw-RGBA image (`f=32`, explicit `s`/`v`, no
   `c`/`r`) drew at exactly **200x100**, aspect 2.000, both axes scale 1.000,
   with its orientation marker in the right corner.
2. **Cell-sized.** The same image sent as `c=10,r=4` drew at **138x112** —
   13.8 px per column, 28 px per row, this pane's real cell size — with a
   five-band source rendering as five equal bands, in order, no offset and no
   clamping. The full source was sampled and scaled to exactly the requested
   cell box, which is what the protocol specifies for `c`/`r`.
3. **The size report, asked from inside the pane** — the path that matters,
   since a reply travels engine → WT connection → ConPTY rather than the
   harness's own pty:

   | query | reply | |
   |---|---|---|
   | `CSI 14 t` | window 1526 x 756 px | |
   | `CSI 16 t` | **cell 14 wide x 28 high** | matches the measurement in (2) |
   | `CSI 18 t` | 109 cols x 27 rows | 109x14 = 1526, 27x28 = 756 — consistent |

#### The actual cause

The producer's own output file was read. Its first APC control block is:

```
a=T,f=32,s=1264,v=632,c=158,r=79,m=1
```

A 1264x632 source — exactly 2:1 — asked to be displayed over 158 columns by 79
rows. Note `1264/158 = 8` and `632/79 = 8`: **the producer computed its cell
counts assuming 8x8 pixel cells.**

`c`/`r` in the Kitty protocol mean "scale this image to fill that many cells",
so with real 14x28 cells the terminal correctly draws it at 158x14 = 2212 by
79x28 = 2212 — **a perfect square**. Aspect 2.000 in, 1.000 out. That is the
whole distortion, and kitty itself would render it identically.

#### What to do about it

Nothing here. In the producer, either:

- **omit `c`/`r`** and send only `s`/`v`, letting the terminal place the image at
  its natural pixel size (probe 1 shows this is exact), or
- **query `CSI 16 t`** and compute `c`/`r` from the reported cell size, which
  this terminal answers correctly.

#### The trap worth remembering

Two of the three hypotheses this entry originally carried were wrong, and both
were reachable by reading source: a row-pitch mismatch (dead — upstream converts
every image to RGBA before upload, `image.zig:851-872`) and a DPI error in our
geometry (dead — probe 1 is exact). A third, "our renderer mis-samples when
scaling", survived one bad screenshot: a 13-row image placed near the bottom of
the screen **scrolled while drawing**, which looks exactly like a vertical
sampling offset. Shrinking the image until it could not scroll made the same
test read clean.

A self-describing source image — coloured bands rather than a solid fill — is
what turned that around. It says directly which source rows landed where, so an
offset, a squeeze and a clamp are distinguishable by looking instead of inferred
from a bounding box.
